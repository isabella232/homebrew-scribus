homebrew-scribus
================
A Homebrew (the Mac OSX Package Manager) tap for installing Scribus.
This is only for the latest version of 1.5.0svn trunk. There is no 1.4.x unless someone wants to make it. 

Note (from the Scribus core devs)
====
*  Don't use 1.5 for production, don't rely on it to work day to day. Use stable version (1.4.4) for that.
*  If you ignore the above, be prepared to stay on a version that works for you. There's normally no
     reason to change every day.
*  No bugs for homebrew solutions in the Scribus tracker.
*  More info http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Scribus_and_Homebrew
