homebrew-scribus
================
A Homebrew (the Mac OSX Package Manager) tap for installing Scribus.
This is only for the latest version of 1.5.0svn trunk. There is no 1.4.x unless someone wants to make it. 

Usage
=====
Coming Soon for now see http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Scribus_and_Homebrew

Todo
====
* Fix cmake issue where "-- No source header files will be installed" which doesn't build with debugger symbols also "LCMS 2 Debug Library: LCMS2_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND" ?
* Get libcdr in to homebrew repo and enabled
* Fix up formula to install by specific revisions
* Research "No OSG found, building without 3D Extension" 

Note (from the Scribus core devs)
====
*  Don't use 1.5 for production, don't rely on it to work day to day. Use stable version (1.4.5) for that.
*  If you ignore the above, be prepared to stay on a version that works for you. There's normally no
     reason to change every day.
*  No bugs for homebrew solutions in the Scribus tracker.
*  More info http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Scribus_and_Homebrew
